The most famous of these models is called BERT (Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers), but there are many models you can choose from for this purpose. Look around e. g. here: [https://www.sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/pretrained_models.html ](https://www.sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/pretrained_models.html )\n",

These embeddings learned during the training-process. When presented with new texts, as we are going to do below, the model cuts the text up into the tokens, and selects the associated embeddings. The embeddings then undergo a process called 'attention' in which the individual representations interact with, and change each-other. In this process, the model adapts the individual embeddings to their context, and changes e.g. the embeddings associated with 'bank', depending on whether the word is close to 'river', as opposed to 'deposit'. Finally, the embeddings of all the tokens in the text get summarized, e.g. by averaging thm. This final embedding, whihc contains information from all the tokens then gets used to represent the whole text.\n",

One way of analyzing these similarities is by using UMAP (Uniform Manifold approximation and Projection). What UMAP effectively does is compute a nearest-neighbour graph, in which each text is linked to the other texts that are most similar to it, reweigh the graph so that high density areas don't dominate, and then layout the resulting network in a lower dimensional space using a force based simulation, in which linked nodes are pulled together, while unconnected nodes are pushed apart. This reproduces important features of outr dataset, whoch originally where encoded in several hundred dimensions in two. For an intuitive explanation to umap, see: [https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/](https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/). Below we produce a layout in two dimensions:"

        "To get a better idea of what the the different areas of the plot mean, we can employ clustering. Because the 2-d umap looses a lot of information (768 Dimensions just don't fit that well into 2), and most clustering-algorithms struggle with high dimensional data due to the so-caled *curse of dimensionality*, we run another UMAP-reduction to 30 dimensions, on which we cluster. Here we employ genieclust, a flexible version of agglomerative clustering([https://genieclust.gagolewski.com/weave/basics.html](https://genieclust.gagolewski.com/weave/basics.html)), that allows us to tune how imbalanced we allow cluster sizes to be."
